Players will be sorted into one of the two.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Operative</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a character within the world of Agents of Influence who is not a player, but is a member of an Agency.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Headquarters Website</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the place from which players begin and end their experience in Agents of Influence: www.agentsagainstdisinfo.com</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>&ldquo;The Event&rdquo;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the entire experience of Agents of Influence contained within the Headquarters Website.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mission</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A timed activity that you click &ldquo;Accept&rdquo; to participate in. Missions begin on the Headquarters Website and&nbsp; then link you to specific other sites on the internet. Missions may be Single Player or MultiPlayer.</span></li><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single Player Mission: One of the five missions that Agents can participate in that will each award one Agent from each Agency a position in the Finale.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MultiPlayer Mission: The one mission that occurs on Day 5 that will not result in a finalist Agent. Instead it will grant the winning Agency an advantage during the Finale.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active Time: Each Solo Mission is active from 9:00 a.m. PST through 6:00 p.m. PST on the day it is released. During this time, Agents can play the Solo Mission with the goal of getting a finalist position. The solo missions will still be available to play after the Active Time is over, but the player will not be eligible for a finalist position.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finale: The last day of the event. Two teams, each comprised of finalist players from their respective Agencies, will compete for victory.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Before Playing</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to access and play in Agents of Influence, you will need a stable internet connection and a desktop computer or laptop that can access the internet. Please note that Agents of Influence is </span><strong>not</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> optimised for screens smaller than 1024x768 and we do not promise you a smooth player experience on such devices.</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain Missions may call for accounts with third party sites in order to access information vital to playing the game. These third party sites include:</span></li><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddit</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An email account</span></li></ul></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When first arriving on the Headquarters Website (agentsagainstdisinfo.com) players who have not created an account will be prompted to sign up. To sign up, you will need to enter:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An email address that you use and have access to</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A password to secure your account</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sorting into your Agency</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you complete the signup process you will be taken to the Simulation Training Mission to be sorted into your Agency.&nbsp; You will be supplied with prompts walking you through a virtual mission to take down Dr. Disinfo. Each prompt will be accompanied by choices you can make in the given situation. The results of your choices will lead to being selected for one of two Agencies: ORACLE or UMBRA. Each of these Agencies come with their own host of Operatives and style of working through Missions, but ultimately their goals are the same: bring down Dr. Disinfo.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Agency Headquarters Website</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Agency Headquarters is made of different webpages. These webpages are:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Agency Dashboard:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After logging in or signing up for the first time you will be taken to your Agency Dashboard. Its appearance will be decided based on your Agency. Information will be displayed here, such as the daily update video of the day, and a collection of scores from other players to form a leaderboard. From here you can access a number of different pages:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missions Page</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Menu Sidebar</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toolkit</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Missions Page:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you can access your available Missions.&nbsp; Only missions that are available to play will be named and accessible. If Missions are not yet available their Internal Mission Page will be inaccessible.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mission Information Page:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you can see information about the Mission before accepting it.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Menu Sidebar:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pop out sidebar from which you can navigate to several pages. You can also log out of your Agents of Influence account from here. Pages accessible through the Menu Sidebar include::</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAQ</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helpdesk</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About Us</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toolkit:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Toolkit page will show you how to use several of your spy tools that will come in handy on your Missions</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Archived Communications:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From here you can see Archived Transmissions comprised of video briefs from past Missions. You can also view Recent Transmissions to see new information and messages from Operatives that you are given access to over the course of the event.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Us:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about Alterea, Inc., the people who designed and run Agents of Influence.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our Partners:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">View Partners who helped make Agents of Influence possible.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Legal:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">View Terms and Conditions, User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and these Game Rules.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FAQ:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&rsquo;re stuck, you may find answers to your questions in the FAQ page.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Helpdesk:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the FAQ page does not answer your question, the helpdesk will direct you to write an email to our Correspondents who will answer your questions between the hours of 3pm PST and 7pm PST, the active hours of the event.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Playing Agents of Influence</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Player Goal</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your goal as an Agent is to be selected to represent your Agency in the Finale. Each of the five single player Missions will result in one finalist, the Agent who successfully completes that Mission in the shortest time. The Finale will pit two teams of five Agents against each other, each team from one of the two Agencies.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Missions</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day 1 begins with one Mission available. Over the course of several days, new missions will be released&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Missions are made available on Day 2 through Day 5. Each Mission will take you across the internet to gather information vital to helping your fellow Operatives.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Beginning a Mission</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To choose a mission, select the Mission from the Missions Page. You will see more information about the Mission including the narrative premise, third party sites used, and expected time to completion.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can only play one mission at a time, and when you confirm a mission you will only be able to access the rest of the Agency Headquarters website by cancelling the Mission. Note that if this is your first time playing a mission you will forfeit your ability to be a finalist by cancelling the mission before finishing.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prepare for the Mission, you should be sure to sign in to any third party sites before accepting the Mission. Once you accept the mission and confirm it&nbsp; you will be shown a video setting up the story of that Mission. Once the video ends you will be taken to the Internal Mission Page. Once you arrive on this page your time starts.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Playing Missions</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your goal as an Agent is to complete the Mission accurately and in as short a time as you can. Upon completing the mission you will be given a score based on the amount of time you took to complete it. The Internal Mission page will show you all the information you need to complete it. The page will contain one or more text boxes and a Submit button. Your goal is to follow the instructions of the Mission to find certain textual&nbsp; information and submit it in the text box(es).&nbsp; If you incorrectly submit the information in the text box(es) you will be notified, and prompted to try again. Once you successfully submit the correct text in the text box(es) your time will be stopped and you will be notified you were correct. Then you will be shown a video to end the game. From here you will be taken to the Agency Dashboard.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your score for the Mission will be calculated based on the amount of time it took you to complete the Mission, with shorter times getting higher scores and longer times getting lower scores.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Finale</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to Become a Finalist</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finalists are chosen based only on the scores they achieve during the Active Times of each respective Solo Mission. Only the Agent&rsquo;s first attempt at a given Solo Mission will be considered for their Finalist score.&nbsp; If a player cancels a Solo Mission before successfully completing it they will forfeit their opportunity for Finalist eligibility for the particular Solo Mission. The five Solo Missions will each result in one winner per Agency. The single Agent with the highest score for each Solo&nbsp; Mission of their Agency will be chosen to represent the team for that Solo Mission, assuming they have not already been awarded a Finalist position for a previous Solo Mission.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a single Agent achieves the highest score on a Solo Mission and is awarded a Finalist position they become ineligible for any other Finalist positions. The Finalist position for the Mission they are not eligible for will be granted to the next eligible runner up who has also not previously been granted a Finalist position.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Finale Experience</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Finale will consist of a competitive portion that will pit the two Agency teams against each other. The Finale will be broadcast live on several platforms for non-finalist audience members to watch. Operatives and other characters will make appearances at the Finale, and will interact with Finalists.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon completion of the competitive portion, all audience members will be invited to take part in the second collaborative portion in which they will complete as many minigames as they can in a limited time frame.</span></p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong>How to get help</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If while playing Agents of Influence you feel that you need more help or need clarifications on game rules, visit the FAQ section found on the menu tab, or access the Agency Helpdesk by emailing </span><a href="mailto:agents.against.disinfo@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agents.against.disinfo@gmail.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the Helpdesk Page.</span></p><p><br /><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>'
